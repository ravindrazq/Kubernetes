Here are some kubectl commands that you can use to view logs in Kubernetes:

kubectl logs <pod-name>: This command displays the logs for the specified pod.

kubectl logs <pod-name> -c <container-name>: This command displays the logs for the specified container in the specified pod.

kubectl logs -l <label-selector>: This command displays the logs for all pods that match the specified label selector.

kubectl logs -f <pod-name>: This command displays the logs for the specified pod and follows the log output, similar to the tail -f command.

kubectl logs -p <pod-name>: This command displays the previous logs for the specified pod. This is useful if the pod has been restarted and you want to see the logs from the previous run.

You can also use the --since flag to view logs that were generated after a certain time, and the --tail flag to display only the last N number of lines of the logs. For example, kubectl logs <pod-name> --since=2h --tail=100 will display the last 100 lines of logs that were generated in the past 2 hours.
